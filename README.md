# My dual degree project at Indian Institute of Technology Madras was based on topological sensitivity analyses in S. Cerevisiae. I explored various statistical and mathematical modelling based methods during the two-year period of this project. I have attached the project report and if you have any more questions, please feel free to reach out to me.
